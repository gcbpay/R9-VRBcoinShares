Intent of the Intellectual Freedom Software License
----------------------------------------------------------------- 
This license is intended to have all of the properties of the BSD
license while actively working to reform patent law and foster a
more competitive market rather than the creation of intelectual
monopolies enforced by governments.   

Invictus Innovations, Inc is strongly opposed to government enforced
grants of intelectual monopoly because we believe it harms society and
violates physical property rights.  For more complete background on our
position please see "Againts Intellectual Monopoly" by Michele Boldrin and
Levine, David K. which is freely available or may be purchased in physical
form.

Our objection to intelectual monopoly does not protect us from having
others enforce their government granted monopoly on us.  Therefore, it
is necessary for us to acquire a license (exemption) from the 'owners' of
the intelectual monopoly.  The best leverage available to us to acquire such
a license free of charge is our own 'intelectual monopoly' which the 
government will grant us the right to enforce on anyone at our choice.  

We choose to only enforce our grants of monopoly (copyright/patents) on those
who would enforce their monopoly grants on others by demanding royalties or
denying use all together. 

This is not a GPL style copyleft license.  You are free to maintain
trade secrets and release closed-source software derived from our work. Your
only restriction is that you may only use copyright and patent laws against
those whom are seeking to license or prohibit you from violating their
patent or copyright monopolies.  You are also free to charge for your work, 
apply DRM, use 'license' keys, or take any other free-market action to derive
value from your products with the only restriction being on seeking to use the 
government to enforce an intelectual monopoly against someone who has agreed
to the terms of this license.
